# Frontend Framework Adoption ie `Angular` which will simplify development.

## Monolithic Architecture Issues:
    - The admin functionality is scattered across multiple files with similar naming patterns (`routes/admin.js`, `public/js/admin.js`, `public/admin/`), suggesting potential code duplication and inconsistent organization. This fragmentation makes the codebase difficult to navigate and maintain, as related functionality is spread across different directories without clear architectural boundaries.

### Duplicate Code Patterns:
    - Several indicators point to significant code duplication throughout the project. The admin section contains multiple similar HTML files (`ai-chat.html`, `dashboard.html`, `system-logs.html`, `system-settings.html`, `text-to-image.html`, `text-to-voice.html`, `user-management.html`) that likely share common UI components and JavaScript patterns without proper abstraction. The TODO list specifically mentions fixing "duplicate user-controls issue in User Management(Admin)," confirming the presence of redundant code blocks.
